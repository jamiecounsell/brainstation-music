                    Stevie Wonder
                </a>
                is an American musician and a former child prodigy who became one of the most creative musical figures of the late 20th century. His multi-generational hit songs include "My Cherie Amour," "You Are the Sunshine of My Life," "Superstition," "Living in the City," "Boogie on Reggae Woman," "Sir Duke," "That Girl," and "Part-Time Lover."

                Born on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan, singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Stevie Wonder made his recording debut at age 11, becoming a 1960s force to be reckoned with via chart hits like "Fingertips, Pt. 2," "I Was made to Love Her" and "My Cherie Amour." Over the next decade, Wonder had an array of No. 1 songs on the
                pop and R&B charts, including "Superstition," "You Are the Sunshine of My Life," "Higher Ground," "Boogie on Reggae Woman," "Sir Duke" and "I Wish" from the albums Talking Book, Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale and Songs in the Key of Life.

                Wonder continued to churn out hits into the 1980s, including "I Just Called to Say I Love You," the Paul McCartney duet "Ebony and Ivory" and "Part-Time Lover." He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and has continued to record and tour.
