                <p>
                    U2 initially came together in Larry Mullen’s kitchen after posting 
                    a ‘musicians wanted’ ad with the title “Drummer seeks musicians to 
                    form band”, on Saturday 25th September 1976.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adam Clayton had discovered rock'n'roll as a thirteen year old, 
                    after talking his parents into buying him buying his first guitar.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The four teenagers, who initially called themselves 'Feedback', 
                    rehearsed in Larry's Dublin kitchen, Bono on vocals, The Edge on 
                    guitar, Adam Clayton and Larry making up the rhythm section of bass 
                    and drums.
                </p> 
                
                <p>
                    Everyone in the world passed on U2 before we they finally found a 
                    home at Island Records.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    U2's first single, 11 O'Clock Tick-Tock, was released in May 1980. 
                    Boy, their debut album, was released five months later - promoted by 
                    another single, I Will Follow , October, a year later and by May 1983, 
                    they had their first UK number 1 album with War, culmination of a trio 
                    of albums produced by Steve Lillywhite.

                <p>
                    U2 released The Joshua Tree in 1987, and the singles With Or Without 
                    You and the gospel-flavoured I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking 
                    For, went to the very top of the US singles chart.
                </p>  
                    
                <p>
                    The Joshua Tree went on to sell more than 20 million copies and at 
                    the 1987 Grammy Awards, won the band 'Album Of The Year' and 'Best 
                    Rock Performance', the first of what has become a record-breaking 
                    run of Grammy wins. 
                </p> 
                    
                <p>
                    When Time Magazine put the band on its cover with the headline 
                    "Rock's Hottest Ticket", it was only the fourth time a band had 
                    made it to the cover - following The Beatles, The Band and The Who.
                </p>
                    
                <p>  
                    U2’s last album 'Songs Of Innocence' was released on September 9th 
                    2014, out of the blue, at the Cupertino launch of the new iPhone and 
                    Apple Watch. iTunes put the album automatically into the music 
                    libraries of 500million customers in 119 countries around the world. 
                    It would, said Cook, be 'the largest album release of all time.'
